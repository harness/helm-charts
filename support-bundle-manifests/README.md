# Support Bundle Manifests

These example manifests provide a one file solution to collect relevant data for the modules having issues. It contains a manifest file for each module which can be passed to the support bundle utility. For information on how to run the utility, [refer here](https://developer.harness.io/docs/self-managed-enterprise-edition/support-bundle-utility)

## Which support bundle to use?

- If you are not sure which module is having issues or have issues with multiple modules, you can use the `support-bundle-all.yaml` manifest which contains all the services. This should be the go to manifest for most of the cases.

- If you are having issues with a specific module, you can use the manifest for that module, which is present inside `module-wise` directory.

## How to use

### Pre-requisites

- yq (v4 or above) (For installation instructions, refer [here](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq?tab=readme-ov-file#install))

### Usage

After you have followed the installation instructions, run the following command to prepare the support bundle manifest. This script downloads the required manifest from the repository and prepares it for use. Change <your-namespace> with the namespace in which Harness is installed and <your-release-name> with the name of the helm release for Harness.

***Note: Please select the script based on your Operating System***

For Linux:

```bash
bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harness/helm-charts/main/support-bundle-manifests/scripts/linux.sh) <your-namespace> <your-release-name>
```

For MacOS:

```bash
bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harness/helm-charts/main/support-bundle-manifests/scripts/macos.sh) <your-namespace> <your-release-name>
```

For Windows:

```bash
bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harness/helm-charts/main/support-bundle-manifests/scripts/windows.ps1) <your-namespace> <your-release-name>
```

This will create a file named `support-bundle.yaml` in the current directory. You can use this file to collect the support bundle.

***Note: Please select the script based on your Operating System***
