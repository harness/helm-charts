# Chart 0.2.87

- Prior to version 0.2.87, All module level overrides must be present under `harness` key in override file
Eg.
To enable global receivers for "srm", use the following overrides

harness:
    srm:
        enable-receivers: true

- Starting version 0.2.87, All module level overrides must be present at root level in override file and NOT under `harness` key
Eg.
To enable global receivers for "srm", use the following overrides

srm:
    enable-receivers: true

- To change the existing override file, delete the root level "harness" key and de-indent the value (all module level overrides)
